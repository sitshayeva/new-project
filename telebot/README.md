# Telegram Bot Project

This project contains the code for a simple Telegram bot using the Cobra and Telebot libraries in Go.

## Setup and Run

1. Ensure Go is installed and setup on your system.
2. Set the `TELE_TOKEN` environment variable with your Telegram bot token.
3. Run the bot using `go run main.go`.

## Functionality

The bot currently can receive text messages and responds with a generic message. Further functionality can be added by modifying the message handler in `main.go`.
